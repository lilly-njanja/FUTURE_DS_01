🚀 Key Insights

West region leads in sales but also has a higher return rate, suggesting service or product quality concerns.

Technology products (e.g., copiers, machines) dominate sales but also appear in top-returned products — further investigation needed.

Furniture category has relatively higher returns compared to sales contribution, indicating customer dissatisfaction.

Despite a strong 47% YoY sales growth, return-related losses reduce profitability.
